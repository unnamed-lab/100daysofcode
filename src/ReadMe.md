# 100 Days of Code - JavaScript Scripts

Welcome to the "100 Days of Code" JavaScript Scripts repository! This directory contains the script files for each day of my coding challenge. Each script file corresponds to a specific day, allowing you to easily navigate and explore the code written throughout the challenge.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
src/
|-- day1/
|   |-- script.js
|-- day2/
|   |-- script.js
|-- day3/
|   |-- script.js
...
```

Each day's script file can be found within its corresponding folder. For example, the script for Day 1 can be found in the `day1` folder, named `script.js`.

## Navigating the Scripts

To explore the code for a specific day, simply navigate to the corresponding folder and open the script file. You can review the JavaScript code, analyze the implementation, and gain insights into the concepts and techniques explored on that particular day.

## Getting Involved

I invite you to delve into this repository and explore the JavaScript scripts I've written during my "100 Days of Code" challenge. Feel free to provide feedback, suggestions, or ask any questions you may have. Your engagement is valuable as I continue to learn and grow as a JavaScript developer.
